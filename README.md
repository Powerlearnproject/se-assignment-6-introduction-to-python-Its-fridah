# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].



What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Some key features that make Python popular include:

Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced programmers.
Extensive Libraries: Python has a vast standard library and many third-party libraries that simplify complex tasks.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python works on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Community Support: A large and active community contributes to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and frameworks.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automating repetitive tasks.
Game Development: Libraries such as Pygame.
Embedded Systems: Using MicroPython.
Installing Python
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Installing Python on linux
in linux, python come pre-installed and to check the version use python3 --version vesion

Verifying the Installation
Open Command Prompt and run:

python3 --version
setting up a virtual environment

Create a directory and name it
Open terminal and navigate to the directory
Run python3 -m venv myenv (replace myenv with you pr eferable name.
Activate the virtual environment by running source myenv/bin/activate (on Linux)
Python Syntax and semantic
 print("Hello, World)
Explanation

print() is a built-in function that prints its argument to the console.
"Hello, World" is a string literal, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes
Data Types and Variables
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic Data Type

Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 1, 2,
Floats (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -
Strings (str): Sequences of characters, e.g., "hello", 'hello
Boolean (bool): True or False values
List (list): Ordered collections of items, e.g., [1, 2]
Tuple (tuple): Ordered, immutable collections of itemS.
Dictionary (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Set (set): Unordered collections of unique items.
NoneType (None): Represents the absence of a value.
Example Script:

  # Integer
age = 25
# Float
height = 5.9
# String
name = "Alice"
# Boolean
is_student = True
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
# Set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(age, height, name, is_student, numbers, coordinates, person, unique_numbers)

Control Structure
Conditional Statements Are used to execute code based on conditions.

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
Loops Used to execute code repeatedly

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Functiob in Python
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing code and reducing redundancy.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)
Lists and Dictionaries
Differences

Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats.
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs accessed by key.
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
person["city"] = "New York"
print(person)
Exception Handling
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    print("This block always executes")
Modules and Packages
Modules. File containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that can be imported Packages. Directory containing multiple modules and an __init__.py file

import math

print(math.sqrt(16))
File I/O
Reading from a file:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file

lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
